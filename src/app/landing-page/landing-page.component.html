                    Effective Requirements Engineering (RE) has been recognized as a critical component in the success of a software development project.  This has led to a growing identification of the importance of incorporating significant RE components into the curriculum of university degrees in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology and other related areas. Furthermore, many industrial organizations are recognizing the need to develop RE related training programs as part of their ongoing process improvement initiatives. <br><br>

                    Requirement Engineering Education and Training 2018 (REET'18 Workshop) will address issues related to RE education, both as part of a formal university degree and as ongoing skills training within the workplace. The workshop is intended to go much deeper than a surface discussion of curriculum issues and will examine specific ideas and techniques for teaching skills needed by effective requirements engineers.<br><br>
                    
                    In addition to topics related curriculum development, topics related to pedagogical techniques for teaching RE skills are strongly encouraged.  These skills include requirements elicitation, modeling, analysis, conflict negotiation, consensus building, and requirements specification writing, interviewing, and reviewing skills.

                    Accepted papers with at least an author presenting at the Workshop will be published in the IEEE Digital Library. Participants are invited to submit one of the following four kinds of papers:

                  <p mat-line>Short papers can be on any of the topics within the scope of the workshop. They generally will have one of 3 forms: (1) positions papers that reflect on the RE education, (2) experience reports that describe experiences with a particular method for teaching an RE related skill or could describe an innovative approach to incorporating RE education into the degree curriculum, (3) educational study design papers that propose an empirical study where the authors are looking to get feedback prior to completing the study (or where only a proof of concept has been completed. Short papers will be evaluated based on their potential for generating discussion, as well as quality and originality.</p>

                    <p mat-line>Full papers may describe requirements engineering educational techniques and pedagogical approaches, survey results or experiential reports. For example, a full paper might describe a specific technique for teaching an RE skill and include a case study describing its implementation and evaluation of its effectiveness as well as lessons learnt. As another example, a full paper might describe a mature tool for supporting RE training and experience of using the tool with learners.</p>
